## Project Description
In 5 stages in order pipeline architecture, the names of the stages are Instruction Fetch(IF), Instruction Decode(ID), Execute(EX), Memory Access(MEM) and Write Back(WB). The individual stages take one cycle to complete it. But in one cycle multiple stages of multiple instructions can be completed if the instructions are independent. So, our task is to build a simulator which shows the multiple stages of instructions per cycle of in order pipeline architecture. At last the simulator should give how many instructions it read and how many clock cycles it took to complete it.
